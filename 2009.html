			<h2>2009: A Grand Opening</h2>
				<p>
					The new Yankee Stadium, which cost a record $1.5 billion, was constructed
					near the old facility. As built, it had a capacity of approximately 52,000,
					with 52 luxury suites. Monument Park, which holds plaques and monuments
					honoring former Yankees personnel, was built beyond the center field fence;
					its collection was transplanted from the old stadium.[279] For the 2009
					season, the team committed over $400 million in future salaries to three
					free agents: pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, and first baseman
					Mark Teixeira. New York won 90 of its last 134 games, and broke the franchise
					single-season record by hitting 244 home runs. Another club record was
					broken by Jeter, who passed Gehrig as the Yankees' all-time hits leader
					on September 11. New York posted 103 wins in 2009 and beat out the Red
					Sox for the division title by eight games. In the AL playoffs, the Yankees
					defeated the Twins in the ALDS and the Angels in the ALCS, advancing to
					the World Series. There, they faced the defending Series champions, the
					Philadelphia Phillies. Behind a six-RBI effort by Matsui in the sixth
					and final game, the Yankees defeated the Phillies to win their record
					27th Series championship.

			<h2>2010: Phasing out the Core Four</h2>
				<p>
					George Steinbrenner died in July 2010. The Yankees won the league's wild
					card berth, but their title defense was ended by the Texas Rangers in
					the ALCS. Multiple Yankees players set individual marks in 2011. Jeter
					joined the 3,000 hit club on July 9; he was the first player to do so
					while playing for the club. Later in the season, Rivera posted the 602nd
					save of his career, breaking the all-time record that had been held by
					Trevor Hoffman. The Yankees won the AL East, but lost in the ALDS to
					the Tigers. Rivera suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee in
					May 2012 while catching fly balls before a game against the Royals. Even
					without their longtime closer, the 2012 Yankees gained a 10-game lead
					by mid-July, and held off the Orioles to win the division title by a
					final margin of two games. After defeating the Orioles in a five-game
					ALDS, the Yankees were swept by the Tigers in the ALCS.
				</p>
				<p>
					During Game 1 of the 2012 ALCS, Jeter broke his right ankle while attempting
					to field a ball. He was one of many Yankees to miss playing time during
					the club's 2013 campaign; 20 players were placed on the disabled list at
					least once. The team had an opportunity to win a wild-card playoff spot,
					but faded late in the season. It was only the second time since 1995
					that New York did not qualify for postseason play. In the offseason,
					second baseman Robinson Canó departed New York for the Mariners in free
					agency, but the Yankees signed starting pitcher Masahiro Tanaka, who
					was coming off a 24–0 year with Japan's Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles,
					to a seven-year contract. Rodriguez was suspended for the 2014 season
					by MLB for using performance-enhancing drugs. The 2014 Yankees, the last
					with Jeter in their lineup, fell four games short of a postseason berth
					with an 84–78 record. Despite signing several new hitters prior to the
					season, the team finished third from last in the AL in runs scored. The
					offense improved in 2015, ending the regular season with the second-most
					runs in MLB. New York gained a wild card berth with a second-place finish,
					but was defeated by the Houston Astros in a one-game playoff. The Yankees
					traded several veteran players during their 2016 season and received
					Gleyber Torres, Clint Frazier, and Justus Sheffield, among others, in return.
					In August 2016, Rodriguez was released from his contract. The club had
					84 wins, but missed the playoffs for the third time in four years. As
					the Yankees' on-field performance declined after 2009, their attendance
					and television ratings fell; revenue from ticket and luxury suite sales
					at Yankee Stadium decreased by more than 40 percent from 2009 to 2016.
