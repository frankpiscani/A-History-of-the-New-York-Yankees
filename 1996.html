			<h2>1996: The Core Four</h2>
				<p>
					Mattingly did not return to the Yankees for their 1996 season, and the
					club replaced Showalter with Joe Torre. Although the managerial change
					met with a mixed reception by the press, Torre received praise for his
					handling of players as his managerial career progressed; Olney remarked
					that he was able to "defuse powder-keg issues and serve as a buffer
					between Steinbrenner and the players." Jeter won the AL Rookie of the
					Year Award in his first full season with the Yankees, and Pettitte with
					21 wins was second in AL Cy Young Award voting and Rivera posted an 8–3
					record and 2.09 ERA as the club won a division title. New York reached
					the 1996 World Series, where they lost the first two games at home to
					the Atlanta Braves by a combined score of 16–1. But New York won three
					straight contests in Atlanta, including a Game 4 in which they scored
					eight straight runs to rally from a 6–0 deficit. With a 3–2 win in Game
					6, the Yankees won the World Series for the first time in 18 years. For
					1997, the Yankees signed starting pitcher David Wells and allowed closer
					John Wetteland to leave in free agency, enabling Rivera to inherit the
					role. The 1997 Yankees earned a wild card playoff berth, but lost three
					games to two against the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS.
				</p>

			<h2>1998: The Greatest Team Ever</h2>
				<p>
					In preparation for their 1998 season, the Yankees replaced general
					manager Bob Watson with Brian Cashman. The club made many player
					acquisitions, gaining the services of third baseman Scott Brosius,
					second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, and starting pitcher Orlando Hernández.
					The Yankees won 28 of their first 37 games — a stretch that concluded
					with a perfect game pitched by Wells — and by August were 76–27. The 1998
					Yankees are considered by some writers to be among the greatest teams
					in baseball history, having compiled a then-AL record of 114 regular-season
					wins against 48 losses. After playoff series wins over the Texas Rangers
					and Indians, New York defeated the San Diego Padres in four consecutive
					World Series games for their 24th Series title.
				</p>

		<img src="img/pettitte.jpg" alt="Andy Pettitte throws a pitch">
			<h2>1999: The New Dynasty</h2>
				<p>
					After the 1998 season, Wells was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for
					Roger Clemens, who had just completed two consecutive Cy Young Award-winning
					seasons. In a regular season that included another perfect game by a
					Yankees pitcher, this one by David Cone, New York led the AL East with
					98 wins and beat the Rangers in the ALDS. This led to an ALCS against
					the rival Red Sox. New York won the first two games en route to a 4–1
					series win, and went on to sweep the Braves in the 1999 World Series.
					The postseason results gave the 1998–99 Yankees a 22–3 playoff record,
					and the team held a 12-game winning streak in World Series competition
					dating back to 1996. Although the 2000 Yankees had an 87–74 regular season
					record that was the worst among playoff qualifiers, the team won consecutive
					playoff series to claim the AL championship. New York's pennant placed
					them in the 2000 World Series against the cross-town Mets, the first
					Subway Series in 44 years. With a four games to one victory, the Yankees
					gained their third successive title. As of 2019, the 2000 Yankees are
					the most recent MLB team to repeat as World Series champions and the
					Yankees of 1998–2000 are the last team to win three consecutive World
					Series.
				</p>
				<p>
					Free agent pitcher Mike Mussina signed with the Yankees before their
					2001 season began, and the club pulled away from the Red Sox as the year
					progressed to claim another divisional championship, as Clemens won 20
					games. The September 11 attacks interrupted the season, and the resumption
					of baseball in New York became a symbol of how the city recovered from
					the destruction of the Twin Towers. After falling behind 2–0 in the ALDS
					against the Athletics, the Yankees won three straight contests to advance
					to the ALCS. They prevailed in five games against the Seattle Mariners,
					who had tied a single-season MLB record with 116 regular season wins,
					for the team's fourth straight AL pennant. The Arizona Diamondbacks gained
					a two-game lead in the 2001 World Series before the Yankees won three
					consecutive ballgames; New York home runs with two outs in the ninth
					inning of Games 4 and 5 led to extra inning wins in both games, with Game
					4 ended by a Jeter home run.The Yankees' championship streak ended, though,
					as the Diamondbacks won the Series in seven games with a late rally in
					the final inning of Game 7.

			<h2>2003: The Evil Empire</h2>
				<p>
					After the 2001 season, several players from the late 1990s and early
					2000s Yankees teams departed. New York won their fifth AL East title in
					a row in its 2002 campaign, but the Anaheim Angels defeated the Yankees
					in the ALDS. The Yankees' major acquisition in the offseason was leading
					Japanese hitter Hideki Matsui of the Yomiuri Giants. Another signing,
					that of Cuban pitcher José Contreras, led to complaints from Red Sox
					CEO Larry Lucchino, who dubbed his team's rivals "the Evil Empire".
					Tensions between the rivals increased in the coming seasons, and writers
					called the rivalry one of the most intense and well known in North American
					professional sports. By 2003, New York's overall payroll had reached
					almost $153 million, more than the Padres, Brewers, Royals, and Tampa
					Bay Devil Rays combined. Criticism of the Yankees' spending such as
					Lucchino's was frequently raised; during a 15-year stretch from 1999 to
					2013, they had the biggest MLB player payroll every year.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jeter became the Yankees' captain in their 2003 season. The team faced
					the Red Sox in the ALCS. The series came down to a seventh game, and the
					Yankees fell behind before three eighth-inning runs forced a 5–5 tie and
					extra innings. Aaron Boone, a third baseman acquired by New York in a
					mid-season trade, hit a walk-off home run in the eleventh inning to give
					New York the pennant. The Yankees were then defeated by the Florida Marlins
					in the World Series, four games to two. The Yankees added power hitting
					to their lineup in the offseason, signing free agent Gary Sheffield and
					trading for shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who became a third baseman with
					New York. Three of the starting pitchers from the previous season —
					Clemens, Pettitte, and Wells — left the team before the season. Despite
					the losses, the 2004 Yankees managed to top the AL East with 101 wins
					and defeat the Twins three games to one in the ALDS. The victory set up
					an ALCS rematch with the Red Sox. The Yankees took a 3–0 series lead
					before losing four consecutive games, becoming the first team in MLB history
					to lose a best-of-seven series after winning the first three games.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 2005 season featured an AL MVP performance by Rodriguez, who hit a
					league-leading 48 home runs with 130 RBIs and a .321 batting average.
					The Yankees beat the Red Sox for the division title because they won 10
					of their 19 contests against Boston; both teams had 95–67 records. The
					Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated the Yankees in five games in the
					first round of the postseason. The 2006 Yankees kept at the same level,
					as they won the AL East for the ninth straight year but lost in the ALDS
					to the Detroit Tigers three games to one.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rodriguez again won the AL MVP award in 2007, as his 54 home runs and
					156 RBIs topped the AL; he scored 143 runs, the highest single-season
					number by a player since 1985. After starting the year 21–29, the Yankees
					rallied to win the AL's wild card berth; it was the first time in 10
					seasons that they did not win the AL East. New York's season ended in
					the first round of the playoffs; the Indians won the opening two games
					of the ALDS and finished the series in four games. Manager Torre did not
					re-sign after the season, and Joe Girardi took his place. Rodriguez, who
					used an opt-out clause in his contract to become a free agent, stayed
					with the Yankees by signing for $275 million over 10 seasons, an MLB record.
				</p>

		<img src="img/old-stadium.jpg" alt="An aerial view of the old Yankee Stadium">
			<h2>Yankee Stadium's Final Year</h2>
				<p>
					The 2008 season was the Yankees' last in which they played at the original
					Yankee Stadium. The club had sought a new stadium to increase revenues,
					following the example set by other MLB teams. It was also the first in
					which Hal and Hank Steinbrenner ran the team as general partners; though
					George Steinbrenner was still the principal owner on paper, he yielded
					operational responsibilities during the 2007 offseason. Yankee Stadium
					was the site of the 2008 All-Star Game, but for the first time in 14 years
					did not host playoff action. New York ended the year third in the AL East
					and failed to qualify for the postseason.
