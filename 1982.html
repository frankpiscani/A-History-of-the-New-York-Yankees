			<h2>1982: A Fall from Glory</h2>
				<p>
					Following the team's loss to the Dodgers in the 1981 World Series, the
					Yankees had a 15-year absence from the World Series, the longest since
					the time before their initial appearance in 1921. As the 1980s progressed,
					the Yankees regularly spent heavily on free agents who were often aging
					and proved to be declining in performance. The atmosphere of turmoil around
					the club discouraged some players from signing contracts with New York;
					they either ignored the Yankees' offers or used them to get more money
					from other teams. Steinbrenner traded prospects for veterans; sportswriter
					Buster Olney called this "a practice that ultimately inflicted serious
					damage on the organization, leaving the team without the needed influx of
					young and cheap talent." With Steinbrenner at the helm, the team continued
					to change managers frequently; there were 21 managerial changes in his
					first two decades of ownership; Martin served five separate stints as New
					York's manager.
				</p>
				<p>
					The 1982 and 1983 Yankees were fifth and third, respectively. Henry Fetter
					wrote of the following year's team, which had several aging players,
					"The 1984 Yanks had assembled an all-star lineup — but it was that of 1979."
					In what became a trend in future seasons, the Yankees lacked effective
					pitching, undoing the efforts of a top-tier offense that included players
					such as Winfield and first baseman Don Mattingly, one of the few star
					hitters produced by the farm system during the era. Mattingly led the
					AL in batting average in 1984 — beating out Winfield for the league lead.
					The Yankees' 1985 season began with a batting lineup improved by an
					offseason trade for Rickey Henderson, the future MLB career stolen base
					and runs scored record holder. Mattingly was AL MVP in 1985, with 145
					RBI and a personal-best 35 home runs, while Guidry won 22 games. The
					Yankees had 97 wins, two off the division leader Toronto Blue Jays. The
					1986 side's win total fell to 92, but it was only enough for second place
					again behind Boston. Mattingly hit an MLB record six grand slam home runs
					in 1987, but dealt with back pain that limited his effectiveness in his
					remaining years. The Yankees fell to fourth, beginning a six-year streak
					of fourth or worse. The Yankees had the most wins of any MLB team during
					the 1980s, but missed the playoffs eight times during the decade and did
					not win a World Series. Many New York baseball fans chose to support an
					exciting Mets team. From 1984 to 1992, a period that featured their 1986
					World Series victory, the Mets' attendance topped that of the Yankees
					every year. Despite falling attendance, the Yankees' finances were not
					significantly harmed, as they had a 12-year television rights contract
					with the Madison Square Garden network that gave them a record $500
					million and flexibility to increase their payroll if desired.

			<h2>1990: The Foundation of a Revival</h2>
				<p>
					Winfield's tenure with the team ended when he was traded in May 1990.
					The 1990 team lost 95 games to finish at the bottom of the AL East, and
					its .414 winning percentage was the franchise's worst since 1913. The
					Yankees underwent a dramatic change in their front office that year,
					which Glenn Stout cites as a turning point for the club. Winfield had
					become a target of Steinbrenner in previous years. At one 1985 game, he
					criticized Winfield by calling him "Mr. May", that is, a player who only
					performed well early in the season. Steinbrenner also resented Winfield's
					salary as too high, and was critical of a charitable foundation run by
					him. A gambler was paid by Steinbrenner "for damaging information" about
					Winfield, an incident that resulted in an indefinite suspension from
					then-commissioner Fay Vincent in 1990. Under new general manager Gene
					Michael, the Yankees allowed their minor league talent more time to
					improve their skills and more of a chance to play for the Yankees if
					they were good enough. Michael focused on on-base percentage in deciding
					which hitters to pursue, and emphasized left-handed batters who might
					take advantage of Yankee Stadium's short right-field porch. The players
					developed by the team during its rebuilding years included outfielder
					Bernie Williams, a future AL batting average leader, and a group — Derek
					Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Mariano Rivera — that became the
					centerpiece during the 1996–2000 period, and was later nicknamed the
					"Core Four".
				</p>
				<p>
					After a 71-win 1991 season, the Yankees replaced their incumbent manager,
					Stump Merrill, with Buck Showalter, who increased the playing time given
					to young players. While the 1992 Yankees were 20 games behind the AL East
					winner, offseason acquisitions — third baseman Wade Boggs, pitcher Jimmy
					Key, and outfielder Paul O'Neill — helped the 1993 team to an 88–74 record
					and New York's highest finish (second) in seven seasons. By 1994, the
					Yankees had progressed to the point where they led the AL with a 70–43
					record going into the homestretch of the regular season. Their campaign
					was cut short by a players' strike, which resulted in the cancellation
					of the playoffs and 1994 World Series. Many media members believed
					that the Yankees might have reached the World Series if not for the strike.
					A year later, the team reached the playoffs and gave Mattingly his first
					career postseason appearance by winning the first AL wild card berth,
					but it was eliminated in a five-game Division Series (ALDS) against the
					Seattle Mariners.
