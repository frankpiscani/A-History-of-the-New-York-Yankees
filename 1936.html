			<h2>1936: Joltin' Joe</h2>
				<p>
				New York's 1936 season was Joe DiMaggio's first with the club. The young
				center fielder was signed in 1934 from the Pacific Coast League's San
				Francisco Seals, and made his debut with the Yankees in 1936, gaining an
				extra year's experience with the Seals. DiMaggio had a .323 batting
				average, 29 home runs, and 125 RBI in his rookie season. Gehrig won the
				AL MVP Award for his season, in which he hit a career-high 49 home runs,
				with a .354 batting average and 152 RBI. Behind these performances, the
				Yankees had a 102-win season and won the AL pennant, before defeating
				the Giants in the 1936 World Series, four games to two.[109] After a
				second consecutive 102-win regular season and AL championship in the 1937
				season, the Yankees again defeated the Giants in the Series—this time
				winning 4–1.[110] The 1938 Yankees had 48 victories in 61 games during one
				stretch, and won the team's third straight AL championship despite a drop
				in batting performance by Gehrig. In the 1938 World Series, the Yankees
				swept the Chicago Cubs in four games. Ruppert died early in 1939; before
				his death, he sold his ownership interest to Barrow, who took over as the
				Yankees' president. Financially, the club's position had improved from
				earlier in the decade; after posting a net loss of around $170,000 from
				1931 to 1935, the team made over $1 million during the next four years.

			<h2>1939: The End of an Era</h2>
				<p>
					The 1939 Yankees lost the services of Gehrig early in the season. After
					starting the year poorly, he was replaced by Babe Dahlgren, ending his
					streak of 2,130 consecutive games played; he was later diagnosed with
					amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which forced him to retire. Despite
					the loss of Gehrig, New York fielded a team that posted 106 victories
					in 1939, 17 more than the second-place team. DiMaggio was named MVP of
					the league; he led the AL in batting average (.381) and was second in
					RBI (126). Ruffing led the Yankees' pitchers with 20 wins. In the 1939
					World Series, the Yankees swept the Cincinnati Reds in four games for
					the club's fourth consecutive Series championship. Writers have
					given the 1936–39 Yankees acclaim for their success in regular season
					and World Series play; Stout wrote that the 1939 squad was "magnificent",
					and that their campaign was "wholly without drama" besides Gehrig's
					departure from the lineup. In response to the Yankees' dominance,
					after the 1939 season the AL temporarily barred most transactions between
					the last pennant winner and other league teams in an attempt to prevent
					New York from improving its roster. The Yankees' run of championships
					ended in 1940; the team had 18 more losses than in the previous season
					and finished second, two games behind the Tigers.

			<h2>July 4, 1939: Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day</h2>
				<p>
					Doctors released Gehrig's ALS diagnosis to the
					public on June 19, 1939. Two days later, the New York Yankees announced
					Gehrig's retirement, with an immediate public push to honor Gehrig. Lou
					Gehrig Appreciation Day was swiftly planned for July 4, 1939. New York Mayor Fiorello La
					Guardia called Gehrig "the greatest prototype of good sportsmanship and
					citizenship" and Postmaster General James Farley concluded his speech
					by predicting, "For generations to come, boys who play baseball will
					point with pride to your record."
				</p>
				<p>
					Yankees Manager Joe McCarthy struggled to control his emotions. Turning
					tearfully to Gehrig, the manager said, "Lou, what else can I say except
					that it was a sad day in the life of everybody who knew you when you came
					into my hotel room that day in Detroit and told me you were quitting as
					a ballplayer because you felt yourself a hindrance to the team. My God,
					man, you were never that."
				</p>
				<p>
					The Yankees retired Gehrig's uniform number "4", making him the first
					player in Major League Baseball history to be accorded that honor.
					Gehrig received so many various gifts, from VIPs and groundskeepers alike,
					that he began setting them down on the ground, because he no longer
					had the arm strength to hold them. The Yankees gave him a silver
					trophy with all of their signatures engraved on it.
				</p>
				<p>
					On July 4, 1939, Gehrig delivered what has been called "baseball's
					Gettysburg Address" to a sold-out crowd at Yankee Stadium. The following
					text is the official written version published on <a href="https://www.lougehrig.com/farewell/" target="blank">LouGehrig.com</a>:
				</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://www.lougehrig.com/farewell/">
					<p>
						"Fans, for the past two weeks, you've been reading about a bad break.
						[pause] Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of
						the earth. I have been in ballparks for 17 years and have never received
						anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans.
					</p>
					<p>
						"When you look around, wouldn't you consider it a privilege to associate
						yourself with such fine-looking men as are standing in uniform in this
						ballpark today? Sure, I'm lucky. Who wouldn't consider it an honor
						to have known Jacob Ruppert? Also, the builder of baseball's greatest
						empire, Ed Barrow? To have spent six years with that wonderful little
						fellow, Miller Huggins? Then to have spent the next nine years with
						that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best
						manager in baseball today, Joe McCarthy? Sure, I'm lucky.
					</p>
					<p>
						"When the New York Giants, a team you would give your right arm to beat,
						and vice versa, sends you a gift – that's something. When everybody
						down to the groundskeepers and those boys in white coats remember you
						with trophies – that's something. When you have a wonderful mother-in-law
						who takes sides with you in squabbles with her own daughter – that's
						something. When you have a father and a mother who work all their lives
						so you can have an education and build your body – it's a blessing.
						When you have a wife who has been a tower of strength and shown more
						courage than you dreamed existed – that's the finest I know.
					</p>
					<p>
						"So I close in saying that I might have been given a bad break, but
						I've got an awful lot to live for. – Thank you."
					</p>

			<h2>1941: Joe's Hit Streak</h2>
				<p>
					DiMaggio recorded base hits in 56 consecutive games for the Yankees
					during the 1941 season, breaking the MLB record of 44 games that had
					been set by Willie Keeler in 1897. His hitting streak lasted from May
					15 to July 17, when DiMaggio failed to record a hit during a game against
					the Indians at Cleveland Stadium. After winning the AL pennant, the
					Yankees met the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1941 World Series, prevailing
					in five games. In Game 4, the Yankees trailed 4–3 in the ninth inning
					and were on the verge of defeat when Tommy Henrich struck out; Dodgers
					catcher Mickey Owen was unable to field the pitch, allowing Henrich to
					reach base. That began a four-run game-winning rally, and New York won
					the championship in Game 5 the following day.
				</p>

			<h2>1942: The End of the McCarthy Era</h2>
				<p>
					The attack on Pearl Harbor occurred during the offseason, and some
					baseball players immediately joined the Armed Forces. Most of the Yankees'
					roster remained with the team in 1942, and the club repeated as AL
					champions despite Gomez's departure. In the 1942 World Series, the
					Cardinals gave the Yankees their first Series loss since 1926, after
					winning in eight consecutive appearances.DiMaggio and other Yankees entered
					the military before the 1943 season, but the club won the AL championship
					for the 14th time and 7th since 1936. The Cardinals met the Yankees in
					a World Series rematch, and New York won four games to one.
				</p>
				<p>
					After 1943, more of the team's players were drafted into military, and
					the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one position higher than they
					finished the following season.A group consisting of Larry MacPhail,
					Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the
					franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the
					new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that
					included the installation of lights. With the war over and the return
					of players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home
					attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned
					as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during
					the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place.
					Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season
					career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought
					in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated
					the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series,
					MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for
					$2 million.
