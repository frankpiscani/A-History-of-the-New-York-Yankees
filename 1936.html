			<h2>1936: Joltin' Joe</h2>
				<p>
				New York's 1936 season was Joe DiMaggio's first with the club. The young
				center fielder was signed in 1934 from the Pacific Coast League's San
				Francisco Seals, and made his debut with the Yankees in 1936, gaining an
				extra year's experience with the Seals. DiMaggio had a .323 batting
				average, 29 home runs, and 125 RBI in his rookie season. Gehrig won the
				AL MVP Award for his season, in which he hit a career-high 49 home runs,
				with a .354 batting average and 152 RBI. Behind these performances, the
				Yankees had a 102-win season and won the AL pennant, before defeating
				the Giants in the 1936 World Series, four games to two.[109] After a
				second consecutive 102-win regular season and AL championship in the 1937
				season, the Yankees again defeated the Giants in the Series—this time
				winning 4–1.[110] The 1938 Yankees had 48 victories in 61 games during one
				stretch, and won the team's third straight AL championship despite a drop
				in batting performance by Gehrig. In the 1938 World Series, the Yankees
				swept the Chicago Cubs in four games. Ruppert died early in 1939; before
				his death, he sold his ownership interest to Barrow, who took over as the
				Yankees' president.[111] Financially, the club's position had improved from
				earlier in the decade; after posting a net loss of around $170,000 from
				1931 to 1935, the team made over $1 million during the next four years.
