				<h2>1973: George Steinbrenner's Yankees</h2>
					<p>
						Less than a decade into its ownership of the Yankees, CBS moved to sell
						the team in 1972. In eight years, the team posted an $11 million loss
						under CBS; losing money in all but two years. Along with the decrease
						in attendance, the Yankees' television revenues fell by more than 80
						percent from their peak, and in 1973 were more than $1 million below
						what the Mets earned from their broadcasting agreement. A group of
						investors, led by Cleveland-based shipbuilder George Steinbrenner,
						purchased the club from CBS on January 3, 1973 for $10 million. Despite
						an initial promise that he would "stick to building ships" and remain
						in the background, Steinbrenner proved to be a hands-on owner, clashing
						with Burke and forcing him out of his leadership position. Describing
						the level of control displayed by the lead owner, investor John McMullen
						stated, "There is nothing in life quite so limited as being a limited
						partner of George Steinbrenner."
					</p>
					<p>
						The 1973 Yankees held the AL East lead entering August, but faded and
						ended the year fourth. The 1973 season was the team's last in Yankee
						Stadium before the building was renovated. The Yankees had become
						concerned about the drop in attendance and the poor conditions of the
						stadium's surroundings. For a time, New Jersey sought to attract sports
						teams to the Meadowlands Sports Complex, and New York City acted to
						prevent the Yankees from moving. The city paid $24 million to buy Yankee
						Stadium and the adjacent land, and in 1972 agreed to renovations. Work
						on the stadium finished in 1976, and the Yankees were required to play
						at the Mets' home field, Shea Stadium, in 1974 and 1975. During the first
						of those seasons, the team nearly won the AL East, finishing behind the
						Orioles in a race that was decided in the final games. The Yankees were
						helped by an early-season trade that brought first baseman Chris Chambliss
						to the team, and improved to 89 wins from 1973's 80 victories.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the 1974 season, star pitcher Catfish Hunter was declared a free
						agent because of a skipped insurance payment. The Yankees signed him to
						a $3.75 million, four-year contract. It was the beginning of a long-term
						franchise philosophy of using free agency to acquire talent; Stout writes
						that they "were the first team to comprehend what free agency meant",
						as it provided an advantage over lower-spending rivals and generated fan
						and media interest. Hunter had 23 wins during the Yankees' 1975 season,
						but the team did not contend for the playoffs after July. New York fired
						manager Bill Virdon in August and hired Billy Martin as his replacement.
						With Martin as the helm, the Yankees returned to the postseason in their
						first season in the renovated Yankee Stadium, winning the 1976 AL East
						title by a 10 1/2-game margin over the Orioles. Munson was named AL MVP,
						with a .302 batting average and a total of 105 RBIs that was second-best
						in the AL. The 1976 American League Championship Series (ALCS) between
						the Yankees and Kansas City Royals went to a deciding fifth game, which
						was won by New York on a walk-off home run by Chambliss. The Yankees did
						not win a game against the Cincinnati Reds in the 1976 World Series.

			<h2>1977: The Bronx Zoo</h2>
				<p>
					Free agency was introduced more fully from the 1976 offseason;
					outfielder Reggie Jackson, who had spent one season with the Orioles
					after being traded by the Athletics, was the most significant player
					available in that first offseason. Steinbrenner signed Jackson to
					a five-year, $2.96 million contract, giving the Yankees a key player,
					but one who had difficulty fitting in with the rest of the team. Martin
					had opposed Jackson's signing, and many players were angered by comments
					Jackson made that were critical of Munson. Jackson and Martin nearly
					came to blows in the Yankees' dugout during one game against the Red Sox,
					in which Martin removed Jackson for being slow to field a ball. The
					incident sparked media reports of disputes between Martin and Steinbrenner,
					and further conflict between Martin and Jackson. The Yankees of the
					late-1970s, noted for clubhouse conflict and on-field success, were later
					nicknamed "The Bronx Zoo", after a book of the same name by pitcher
					Sparky Lyle, and at the time, New York and the baseball world were agog
					at their antics. The 1977 Yankees won the AL East and defeated the
					Royals in the 1977 ALCS. Trailing 3–2 in the top of the ninth inning of
					the decisive fifth game, the Yankees scored three times to gain a berth
					the World Series. Against the Dodgers, the Yankees prevailed in six
					games for their first Series championship since 1962. Jackson hit a record
					five home runs in the Series, including three in Game 6 on consecutive
					pitches, against three different Dodgers pitchers. Jackson gained
					his own candy bar and the nickname "Mr. October".
				</p>
				<p>
					Before their 1978 season, the Yankees added relief pitcher Goose Gossage,
					even though their closer was reigning Cy Young Award winner Lyle. By the
					middle of July, the team was 14 games behind the Red Sox and infighting
					had begun again. After making comments to reporters criticizing both
					Jackson and Steinbrenner, Martin resigned and Bob Lemon was hired as
					manager. The Yankees closed the gap that Boston had opened on them, and
					by the start of a four-game series at Fenway Park on September 7, the
					Red Sox' lead was down to four games. Over the course of the series,
					nicknamed "The Boston Massacre", the Yankees outscored the Red Sox 42–9,
					winning each game. The teams finished the regular season with identical
					records, and an AL East tie-breaker game was held on October 2. Losing
					2–0 in the seventh inning, the Yankees took the lead on a three-run home
					run by shortstop Bucky Dent, and eventually won 5–4. After beating the
					Kansas City Royals for the third consecutive year in the ALCS, the Yankees
					faced the Dodgers again in the 1978 World Series. They lost the first two
					games on the road, but then returned to Yankee Stadium and won three
					consecutive games before clinching a Series championship in Game 6 in
					Los Angeles. Pitcher Ron Guidry was the Cy Young Award winner in 1978,
					having posted 25 wins against 3 losses with a 1.74 ERA, and 248 strikeouts.
					Eighteen of his strikeouts came in his June 17 appearance against the
					California Angels, which broke the franchise record.
				</p>
				<p>
					On August 2, 1979, Munson was killed in a plane crash. Martin, who had
					returned as manager after Steinbrenner fired Lemon in June, said that
					with his death, "The whole bottom fell out of the team." The 1979 Yankees
					finished fourth with an 89–71 record. Steinbrenner fired Martin after
					the season and replaced him with Dick Howser, who led the Yankees to 103
					wins and the AL East title in 1980. Jackson led the AL with 41 home runs
					and posted a .300 batting average for the Yankees, who finished three
					games ahead of the Orioles. Their stay in the postseason was brief, as
					the Royals beat them in three straight games to win the ALCS. Before their
					1981 campaign, the Yankees signed Dave Winfield to a 10-year contract
					worth $23 million, a record at the time. The season was shortened by a
					strike, and the Yankees qualified for the playoffs by virtue of leading
					the AL East when the work stoppage began. They defeated the Milwaukee
					Brewers in a divisional playoff round in five games. and won the AL pennant
					with three straight wins over the Athletics in the ALCS. The Yankees won
					the first two games of the 1981 World Series against Los Angeles, but the
					Dodgers won the next four games and the championship.
