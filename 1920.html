			<h2>1920: The Most Famous Transaction in Sports</h2>
				<p>
				On December 26, 1919, the Yankees made an agreement with the Red Sox to
				purchase outfielder Babe Ruth for $25,000 cash and $75,000 in promissory
				notes. The deal, which was announced on January 5, 1920, was called "the
				most famous transaction in sports" by author Glenn Stout.[54] After tying
				for the MLB home run lead in 1918 with the Athletics' Tilly Walker (with
				11), Ruth broke the single-season record with 29 in 1919.[55] At the same
				time, he sought a new contract that would double his $10,000 yearly
				salary.[56] After the trade, Boston did not win another World Series
				championship until 2004; an alleged jinx against the Red Sox, which was
				known as the Curse of the Bambino (after a nickname for Ruth), was first
				brought up when they lost the 1986 World Series and became widely
				discussed after Dan Shaughnessy authored a book with the title.[57] The
				deal became a symbol of "how things [would] always go wrong for the Red
				Sox and right for the Yankees", according to Stout.[58]
				</p>
				<p>
					With Ruth in the lineup, the Yankees' fortunes were transformed.[59]
					Playing on four World Series champion teams, Ruth hit 659 home runs
					and scored 1,959 runs; both marks are team records as of 2018. He is
					second in club history with 1,978 runs batted in and accumulated 2,518
					hits as a Yankee, third on the team's all-time list.[60] As well as
					prowess on the field, Ruth had a larger-than-life personality,
					bringing him and his team a huge amount of press and public attention.
					[61] The addition of Ruth helped the Yankees increase their attendance
					to 1,289,422 for the 1920 season; it was the first time that any MLB
					team drew more than one million fans in a year.[62] His skills and c
					harm appealed to large segments of the New York City population; Stout
					wrote that "He belonged to everyone."[63] New York was the AL attendance
					leader for 13 of Ruth's 15 seasons with the team; the Yankees became
					solidly profitable as well, making over $370,000 in 1920 and remaining
					in the black for the rest of the decade.

			<h2>1921: First World Series win and Murderers' Row</h2>
				<p>
					The 1921 season began a 44-year period in which the Yankees were,
					according to author Richard Worth, "The greatest sustained winning
					'empire' in sports".[69] Ruth surpassed his own record by hitting 59
					home runs. He also led MLB in on-base percentage with a .512 mark for
					the season.[70] The Yankees won the AL pennant for the first time,
					winning 98 games in the regular season; the total gave them the league
					championship by a margin of ​4 1⁄2 games over Cleveland. In the
					best-of-nine 1921 World Series, they faced the Giants and won the first
					two games, but their opponents claimed the Series title when they won
					five of the next six games. Ruth suffered an arm infection, which
					limited his playing time in the later part of the Series.[71] He and
					Bob Meusel participated in exhibition games during the offseason, in v
					iolation of MLB rules forbidding players on pennant-winning teams from
					barnstorming after the World Series. Season-long suspensions were
					considered a possibility, but Landis decided to suspend the pair for
					six weeks.[72] Despite the setback, New York had 94 wins and repeated
					as AL champions. The St. Louis Browns were the closest pursuers,
					finishing one game behind New York. In the World Series, the Yankees
					again faced the Giants in an all-New York matchup; the Series changed
					to a best-of-seven format that year. The Giants defeated the Yankees
					in five games, including one that ended in a tie when it was suspended
					because of darkness.
				</p>
			<h2>1929: The Yankees and the Great Depression</h2>
				<p>
					The Yankees' run of pennants was broken up by a rising Philadelphia
					Athletics team, which denied the Yankees a fourth straight AL
					championship in 1929.[97] The team's manager, Huggins, died on September
					25. After Art Fletcher managed for the rest of the year, Shawkey took
					the position for the 1930 season, in which the Yankees had a third-place
					finish.[98] The Yankees fired Fletcher and hired Joe McCarthy; in his
					first season as manager, the team won 94 games but finished second behind
					the Athletics.[99] McCarthy's team was undergoing a transition from
					Murderers' Row; new contributors included Bill Dickey, who had first
					played for the Yankees in 1928, and pitchers Red Ruffing and Lefty Gomez.
					[100] Ruffing, who had a 39–96 record with the Red Sox before being
					traded to New York, ended up 231–124 in his Yankees career.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1932, McCarthy's Yankees returned to the top of the AL with 107 wins,
					enough for a 13-game margin over the Athletics.[102] The Yankees met
					the Chicago Cubs in the 1932 World Series and swept them four games to
					none. Gehrig had three home runs, eight RBI, and a .529 batting average
					for the Series, while Ruth contributed a pair of home runs in the third
					game at Chicago's Wrigley Field. The second of Ruth's home runs was his
					"called shot"; after pointing towards the center field stands, according
					to some post-game press reports, Ruth homered to break a 4–4 tie in the
					fifth inning. Although accounts of the incident vary greatly, author
					Eric Enders called the home run "the most talked-about hit in baseball
					history".
				</p>
				<p>
					The Yankees began cutting their payroll in 1933, as their finances were
					strained by the Great Depression. Regardless, the makeup of the team was
					minimally impacted in comparison to the Athletics, who were forced to
					sell key players to lower their expenses.[104] From 1933 to 1935, the
					Yankees posted three consecutive second-place finishes.[105] Ruth's
					performance declined from previous seasons in 1933 and 1934, his final
					years with the team. The Yankees released Ruth from his contract before
					the 1935 season, and Gehrig took a leadership role for the club; he was
					named New York's captain.[106] New York was beginning to see results
					from an initiative to buy minor league teams in an effort to reduce the
					cost of obtaining players; after buying their first minor league club
					in 1929, the Yankees had a 15-team system by 1937. Players developed in
					the farm system entered the Yankee lineup beginning in the mid-1930s,
					and into the early 1960s this remained the team's primary player
					acquisition method.[107] McCarthy worked to regulate player behavior in
					areas such as mental focus and off-field attire; the Yankees acquired
					a "corporate image" that they retained for many years.
