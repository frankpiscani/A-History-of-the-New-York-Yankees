			<h2>1901: A Prehistory</h2>
				<p>
					In 1901, their first season, the Orioles had a 68–65 win–loss record
					and finished in fifth place in the AL. During the season, there were
					numerous disputes between Johnson and McGraw over disciplinary issues,
					which continued into the following year. Rumors began to spread that
					Johnson was interested in relocating the team to New York City, in an
					attempt to compete directly with the NL. McGraw left the Orioles and
					joined the New York Giants as their manager; he transferred his interest
					in the Baltimore team to the Giants as part of the deal. Several Orioles
					— including Roger Bresnahan and Joe McGinnity — joined the Giants after
					McGraw's departure, and the Giants gained a majority of the Orioles'
					stock. The league managed to take back control of the team from the
					Giants; after the Orioles forfeited a game because they lacked enough
					active players, Johnson ordered that the team be "restocked with players
					essentially given away by the other teams in order to play out the schedule",
					according to author Marty Appel. The Orioles finished last in the league
					both in the standings and in attendance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The AL and NL signed an agreement after the 1902 season that ended the
					leagues' battles for players, which had led to increasing salaries.
					Johnson sought the right to locate an AL team in New York City, which
					was granted as part of the leagues' peace agreement. His intention was
					for the team to play in Manhattan, but the idea was opposed by Giants
					owner John T. Brush and former owner Andrew Freedman, who were connected
					to the city's Tammany Hall political organization. They blocked several
					potential stadium locations, before a pair of Tammany Hall politicians,
					Frank J. Farrell and William Stephen Devery, purchased the New York franchise
					in the AL. The pair paid US$18,000 for the team. It is not clear whether
					Farrell and Devery purchased the remains of the Orioles and moved them to
					New York, or if they received an expansion franchise. It was the last
					change in the lineup of MLB teams for half a century.
				</p>

			<h2>1903: A move to New York</h2>
				<p>
					The ballpark for the New York team was constructed between 165th and
					168th Streets, on Broadway in Manhattan. Formally known as American
					League Park, it was nicknamed Hilltop Park because of its relatively
					high elevation. The team did not have an official nickname; it was often
					called the New York Americans in reference to the AL. Another common
					nickname for the club was the Highlanders, a play on the last name of
					the team's president, Joe Gordon, and the British military unit, the
					Gordon Highlanders. The team acquired players such as outfielder Willie
					Keeler and pitcher Jack Chesbro. The player-manager was Clark Griffith,
					obtained from the Chicago White Sox. On April 22, 1903, the Highlanders
					began their season with a 3–1 loss to the Washington Senators; eight days
					later, they won their first game in Hilltop Park, defeating the Senators
					6–2. New York fell out of contention for the AL pennant in May, falling
					to seventh place after playing games away from Hilltop Park for a 24-day
					period while construction on the stadium concluded. With a final record
					of 72–62 after wins in 19 of 29 games played in September, New York finished
					in fourth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chesbro won 41 games in New York's 1904 season, still an AL record. New
					York contended for the AL pennant with the Boston Americans (later nicknamed
					the Red Sox); Johnson aided New York by helping the team acquire multiple
					players in trades, including Boston's Patsy Dougherty. Boston and New York
					faced each other in a season-ending five-game series that decided the
					pennant winner, and was played from October 7–10. Boston won two of the
					first three games, which meant that New York needed to win the two
					contests scheduled on October 10 to win the AL title. With the score of
					the first game tied 2–2 in the ninth inning, Chesbro threw a wild pitch
					that allowed a runner on third base to score, giving Boston a 3–2 victory
					that clinched the AL pennant; New York won the now-meaningless second game.
				</p>
				<p>
					New York's performance declined in 1905, as numerous pitchers dealt with
					arm injuries and conditioning issues. After losing 18 of 25 games in May,
					the Highlanders ended the season in sixth. In its 1906 season, New York
					again contended for the AL championship. With 13 games left, the team
					held a one-game lead over the White Sox, but finished in second place
					three games behind Chicago. According to Appel, "What would follow would
					be a string of mediocre to bad seasons and not a very good attraction for
					baseball-crazed New York fans." New York recorded a fifth-place finish
					in 1907, with 70 wins, 22 fewer than the league champion Detroit Tigers.
					The 1908 and 1909 teams finished last and fifth, respectively, and there
					were multiple managerial changes in the period.
				</p>
				<p>
					New York had a second-place finish in 1910, but did not seriously contend
					for the pennant. Manager George Stallings and first baseman Hal Chase,
					the team captain, clashed towards the end of the season; facing opposition
					from Ban Johnson, who wanted him to resign as manager, Stallings left
					the position. Chase managed New York's last 14 games. The following season,
					New York had a sixth-place finish. Early in the season, New York allowed
					the Giants to play in Hilltop Park after the Giants' stadium, the Polo
					Grounds, burned down; the arrangement lasted until June 28, when the
					rebuilt Polo Grounds opened. Chase resigned as manager before New York's
					1912 season; Harry Wolverton accepted the position. That year, New York
					had a last-place finish with a record of 50–102, the winning percentage
					of .329 the lowest-ever for the club.
				</p>
				<p>
					After their first couple of seasons in New York City, team ownership
					infrequently invested in new players. The ownership group of Farrell
					and Devery spent their money on personal pursuits such as gambling,
					leaving them with little to put into the team. New York's star player,
					Chase, consorted frequently with gamblers. Author Jim Reisler dubbed him
					"the most crooked player to ever play the game" because of reports that
					he took part in game fixing. The club also had difficulty drawing fans
					to Hilltop Park. Appel wrote that "maybe the best thing you could say
					about the ballpark was that it never burned down." By the end of the
					1912 season, Farrell was searching for a site to build a new stadium on.
				</p>

			<h2>1913: New Owner, New Name</h2>
				<p>
					New York started playing home games at the Polo Grounds in 1913 as tenants
					of the Giants. Before the 1913 season, the team gained an official nickname
					for the first time. Either "Yankees" or "Yanks" had been used frequently
					since 1904 in newspapers such as the New York Evening Journal, since
					"Highlanders" was hard to fit in headlines. Such unofficial nicknames
					were common during that era, but thereafter the official name took hold
					— the New York Yankees.
				</p>
				<p>
					A third major league, the Federal League (FL), began play in 1914 and
					lasted for two years. While the Yankees did not have to contend with
					direct competition for fans, as the FL chose to place its New York City
					franchise in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan, the team nearly lost leading
					pitcher Ray Caldwell to the rival league after the 1914 season. With the
					Yankees finishing seventh in 1913 and sixth in 1914, Farrell and Devery
					sold the team to brewery magnate Jacob Ruppert and former United States
					Army engineer Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston. The Yankees had rarely been
					profitable over the previous 10 years, and carried debts of $20,000. The
					sale was completed on January 11, 1915, as the pair paid a combined $460,000.
					Ruppert called the team "an orphan ball club, without a home of its own,
					without players of outstanding ability, without prestige." The new owners
					intended to spend freely to improve the club's talent level and made a
					major purchase in 1915, buying pitcher Bob Shawkey from the Philadelphia
					Athletics. In spite of this, the Yankees' 69 wins were only enough for
					fifth in the league. After wearing different designs during the Highlanders
					years, in 1915 the Yankees introduced white uniforms with pinstripes and an
					interlocking "NY" logo during games at the Polo Grounds; this remains
					their home uniform design today. For road games, the team began to wear
					gray uniforms with "New York" across the chest from 1913; the Yankees
					still wear similar garb.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following the acquisition of third baseman Frank "Home Run" Baker from
					the Athletics, the 1916 Yankees had 80 wins and contended for the AL
					pennant for most of the season, before suffering a run of injuries to
					key players, including Baker. In the Yankees' 1917 season, New York
					finished in sixth; Bill Donovan, the club's manager since 1915, was
					fired in the offseason. Ruppert replaced him with Miller Huggins,
					completing the hire while Huston was overseas fighting in World War I.
					The Yankees contended for first place in the war-shortened 1918 campaign
					along with the Red Sox and Cleveland Indians, but lost numerous players
					to military service and were fourth at 60–63. After the season, the Yankees
					acquired three players — including outfielder Duffy Lewis and pitcher Ernie
					Shore — in a trade with the Red Sox, the winners of the 1918 World Series.
					In 1919, the club made another trade with Boston, acquiring pitcher Carl
					Mays for two players and $40,000. The midseason deal provoked a dispute
					between the teams and Ban Johnson, who unsuccessfully attempted to block
					it. Mays had a 9–3 pitching record as a Yankee, and the team improved
					to 80–59 for the season; the mark was good for third in the AL. The 1919
					season was the first in which the Yankees played games at the Polo Grounds
					on Sundays; until then, blue laws had banned Sunday baseball in New York
					state. The Yankees' attendance more than doubled in 1919, rising to about
					619,000. The Giants soon moved to force the Yankees out of the Polo Grounds,
					in an effort to secure more Sunday home games.
