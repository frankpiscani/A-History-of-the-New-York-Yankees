			<h2>1965: A Decline</h2>
				<p>
					In 1964, CBS announced that it was purchasing 80 percent of the Yankees
					for $11.2 million. The television network bought the remaining 20 percent,
					originally retained by Topping and Webb, during the next two years. Topping
					left as team president after the sale; CBS executive Mike Burke replaced him.
					From 1962 to the sale, Topping and Webb had sharply curtailed the Yankees'
					investment in their minor league system, to show greater profits. As a result,
					the team lacked capable replacements for its aging players. Other factors
					affected the club's fortunes as well. The team had been slow in signing
					African American players even after Howard, and lost the opportunity
					to sign future stars. As most American League clubs dragged their feet in
					integrating their rosters, the rapid decline of the Yankees' white stars
					left them on the same footing as the rest of the league. Also, the 1965
					introduction of the MLB draft, which allowed the clubs with the worst
					records to have the first selections, meant that the Yankees could not
					outbid other teams for young talent. Their trade pipeline with the A's
					had dried up by 1960, as new A's owner Charlie Finley announced his intention
					to avoid trading with New York. Competition for the attention of local fans
					had been provided by the expansion New York Mets, founded in 1962. By 1964,
					the new club started a 12-year streak of outdrawing the Yankees; the Mets
					also won the 1969 World Series.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Yankees had a record of 77–85 in 1965, and their sixth-place finish
					was their lowest since 1925. It was only their second finish in the
					second division since 1918. Johnny Keane, who was hired to succeed Berra
					as manager, was fired after the Yankees lost 16 of 20 games to start their
					1966 season; Houk named himself as Keane's replacement. A last-place
					finish — their first since 1912 — followed at season's end, and the
					Yankees ended up one position higher, ninth, the following season. Ford,
					Howard, Mantle, and Maris all retired or were traded to other clubs between
					1966 and 1969. Attendance at Yankee Stadium fell to between 1 and 1.3
					million fans per season from 1965 to 1971, and dropped below 1 million
					in 1972. One 1966 game had a crowd of 413 fans; television announcer Red
					Barber was fired by the Yankees after discussing the low attendance
					during his telecast.
				</p>
				<p>
					After fifth-place finishes in 1968 and 1969 (the latter in the newly
					created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved
					to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the
					Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season
					for the Yankees and won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York
					had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970, but
					in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late
					in the season, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in
					the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth by the end of
					their campaign with a record of 79–76.
